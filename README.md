This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses Material UI library and Spring Boot as backend. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a ready to use web application with minimal effort. The react-router is also configured and a bunch of layouts have also been included to get started right away. The data is hardcoded at the moment but i'll be connecting it to a noSQL db as I start learning it.

More components and features will be supported as I continue experimenting with React, Spring, and MUI. 

You can find the backend of this project here: [spreact-backend] (https://github.com/saranshbansal/spreact-backend)
